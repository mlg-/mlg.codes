  <h2>Review: King Me by Roger Reeves</h2>
</header>
    "I have an animal for every occasion. And another / for the occasion after," announces the speaker of "Every Casket, a Pause," from poet Roger Reeves' debut effort, <i>King Me</i>. Indeed, Reeves endows this dense volume with a menagerie of beasts—bees hum in and out of the pages, and many other animals (including a good number of birds) reappear throughout, offering the reader a plethora of wild, vivid images on which to attach distinctly human ideas about agency, oppression, love, and family. Sometimes this obsessive use of the natural world and its inhabitants comes with a tongue-in-cheek quality—"I should say something about the beauty of cranes," ("Do Not Enter"), and sometimes they are a necessary conduit to a meaning that is only available through their interpolations— "...I can't sing without hearing a man / slipping below water clean as butter, clean / as a roach sliding down the thin throat of a crow" ("Self-Portrait as Ernestine 'Tiny' Davis"). Whether with tender humor or as a means to utilize the cold reality of a naturalist pecking order as motif, Reeves pulls these images with a practiced ease. A normalized convention of natural metaphor and then an epiphany is upended, since Reeves does not use his zoology in such formulaic arrangements. In one poem which has seen a lot of critical acclaim (and rightfully so), a horse observes the brutal death of Emmett Till:
    <blockquote>This horse lies, eyes open,<br/>
    among the stones and freshwater<br/>
    crawfish in Money, Mississippi.<br/>
    She listens to the men's boots break<br/>
    the water when they drop a black boy's body<br/>
    near her head, then pick him up,<br/>
    only to let him fall——again,<br/>
    there: bent and eye-to-eye with her<br/>
    as though decaying is something<br/>
    that requires a witness.</blockquote>
    The beauty and horror of this poem both lie in the linked image of the dead mare and the dead boy. Reeves offers the implicit suggestion that we consider how little Till's life mattered in his time, how his horrific murder was as seemingly justified in a deeply racist Mississippi as the mare left to die in the creek. The sadness of the poem becomes nearly unbearable with the imagined inner monologue of the horse, as she testifies to what she saw: "<i>the boy's neck finally snapped / from the weight of the mill fan</i>." In the tradition of Nikki Giovanni, this is one of the tenderest and most harrowing re-tellings of Emmett Till's story that exists in our poetic record.

    Likewise, as in "The Mare of Money," the poems, themselves, are not in my opinion really <i>about</i> the many animals that lurk in their lines. Rather, Reeves possesses a breathtaking range of historical allusion and even a handful of special scientific terminology that gives the diction of the work an encyclopedic depth. He tells us what to know about the business of being human by mining our history, our pop culture, and our earth. His willingness to juxtapose very serious poems about oppression and suffering alongside sly contemporary images lends itself to surprising effects that somehow work in concert. This is an author who is not afraid to put Mike Tyson and the ghastly collection of ears he has bitten off into a poem with a Labrodoodle, a narwhal, and a pair of Nikes. It sounds utterly absurd, but it works, and Reeves looks upon Tyson with a kind of tender, deeply pained acknowledgment of the cultural baggage weighing down black masculinity, both the speaker's own as well as the poems other victims—the lynched, the dog-named. A Cher song makes a brief appearance in one poem, Outkast in another, while still others dwell on scenes of social devastation and historical pain, sometimes in the very same poem. Anne Frank laying down in the attic, gandy dancers, lynchings, starvation in Poland, Victorian scenes of degradation, civil rights hoses and mutilated black bodies, Neruda, James Brown, Walt Whitman, Rilke...all thread in and out of their various scenes with attention to the mechanics of suffering that the work continually explores. Reeves seems to want to know what happens to civilizations that observe the abject, that participate, even, in its propagations? In several poems, white women are the ones casting unfeeling gazes on scenes of degradation, with chilling effects that hearken to Hilton Al's <em>White Girls,</em> which I am also reading.
    But back to Reeves, perhaps his study of the barbaric injustices against a litany of "others" in his work is aligned with another of the book's most prevalent images—the mouth. In nearly every poem, a mouth is pressed against something, like a lover or the ground, or full of something, like dirt or diamonds, and ultimately, the truth.
    <blockquote>What to do with the dead I carry in my mouth,<br/>
    Teach me to travel light with their bodies in my belly</blockquote>
    These poems are full of telling, as the mouths indicate. Tongues, speaking, swallowing, and the acts of agency that are either freed or inhibited by the context of these images—Reeves will not allow us to stand at a distance from tragedy or human suffering. Rather, he dials up the images that allow us to feel grief and subjugation in new shades and in unforeseen contexts. While many reviews have focused on a clear current of studied black masculinity in the title and the work inside (which I enjoyed and applaud, see "John Henryism" in particular), I want to add to this conversation by suggesting that I believe Reeves is interested in something that is explicitly queered, something with a range of allusions that resist simple one-to-one notations. His kings are not gender bound, necessarily, as "Self Portrait as Ernestine 'Tiny' Davis," from where the title allusion is culled, is about the blues singer who refused a tour with Louis Armstrong and later opened a gay bar with her lover, Ruby.
    <blockquote>Feed me. Call my appetite a kind kingdom.<br/>
    Call me Queen. King me.</blockquote>
    This rich inside knowledge is thanks to the few excellent footnotes that Reeves provided, although I highly recommend a liberal use of Google for any unfamiliar images in the works, as they make the words emerge with even more beauty and verve. Overall, these moments made me think of Siobhan Somerville's work <i>Queering the Color Line,</i> since for Reeves, issues of race seem to concurrently erupt alongside a queer subjectivity. In one particularly breathtaking poem, a pair of blood fluke parasites cling to each other in a male-to-male pair of canoes: <i>"Schistosoma mansoni"</i>.
    <blockquote>Even as the wood bees knaw on our rigging,<br/>
    let them stack me along your rubs, and let us warp.<br/><br/>

    Warp until we crack. Warp until nothing<br/>
    can slighter or slip between our swollen bows.</blockquote>
    While the poem very clearly is intended to use the parasites (who are canoe-shaped) as a way to enter into a discussion of gay love, I can't help but read into the stacked bodies and the warping wood an image of slave-ship survival. It's only possible in the context of Reeve's wide-ranging command of black history throughout the work that makes such an associative reading possible, but I find it productive as a means of entering the poem from a different angle.
    His work, at its core, seems extremely interested in overlaying the long-repressed violence of the past and stringing it into the present, giving us questions to ask and horrors to answer for beyond the bounds of contemporaneity and a sense of distance. Mary Oliver wrote in <i>A Poetry Handbook</i> that, in poetry, one can "expect to become intimate with the distant voice," (p. 11) and although she means to encourage young writers to read poetry written far before their time, it seems applicable here. Reeves brings us the blood-drenched swaths of history that have been bleached, white-washed, and sanitized; makes us truly intimate with those distant voices, sometimes to the point of extreme pain and discomfort.

    A serious student of the relationships of world history juxtaposed with moments of stateside racial oppression, Reeves offers a steady thematics throughout this excellent, beautiful work: questions of humanity and history, suffering and belonging. His work is a startlingly cutting and dense debut, and I hope to read much more it in the future. I will leave you with a brief passage that seems to crystallize, in plain language, the questions the book wrestles with most prominently. From "Brazil":
    <blockquote>The children waiting for bottles<br/>
    of water to be thrown from each car.<br/>
    The bee above his head, the kites<br/>
    drifting from the hills, the white puffs<br/>
    of cloth, slew-footed, wading into the sky<br/>
    like a wasp drunk on insecticide.<br/>
    <i>Those are suicide notes,</i> he says, <i>the kites</i>.<br/>
    Soon there will be gunfire,<br/>
    drugs, and dead children head-to-foot<br/>
    along the paved and unpaved roads<br/>
    leading in and out of this favela.<br/>
    <i>Do you have this in America?</i><br/>
    This, meaning kites. This, meaning<br/>
    children. This, meaning winter rain<br/>
    unable to flow into the gutters<br/>
    because of bodies lining the streets.<br/>
    I think to tell him of Katrina,<br/>
    but I say nothing of water-<br/>
    melon vines growing around the dark<br/>
    and dead, an unhoed road<br/>
    of children my uncle has left<br/>
    in graves from North Carolina to New Jersey,<br/>
    the bomb, MOVE, the symphony<br/>
    hall of atrocities in which every seat is full,<br/>
    but is this the meaning of diaspora?</blockquote>
