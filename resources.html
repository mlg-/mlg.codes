        <h2>Resources for Aspiring Web Developers and The Code Curious</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Over the past few years learning web development from the ground up and nearly all on my own time, I&#8217;ve amassed a great list of resources for learning to code. In particular, many of my resources are useful for women who want to take part in closing the gender gap in technology, especially in the Boston metro area. I hope that this list will in some small way be a part of my personal mission to empower others to learn even as I myself acquire new skills. </p>
    <h2>Learn to Code in Boston</h2>
    <p><a href="http://thewc.co">The Women&#8217;s Coding Collective</a><br />
    I constantly rave about The Women&#8217;s Coding Collective to other ladies learning to code in the Boston area, and for good reason. They are supremely professional and deliver high-quality courses with solid pedagogy. You can take classes online, but if you&#8217;re local, don&#8217;t miss out on a chance to take in the beautiful views of the CIC where in-person courses often take place. Probably one of the best aspects of the WCC is the fantastic forum access, where you can just bounce ideas off of other women learning similar skills, or get help with a particular hurdle in your personal development. Worth every penny.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/boston">Girl Develop It! (Boston Chapter)</a><br />
    The Boston Chapter of Girl Develop It is often holding classes, mixers, and other events. It&#8217;s a great way to acquire a new skill, and there are many chapters across the country in case you aren&#8217;t local to Boston!</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/boston">General Assembly</a><br />
    General Assembly offers both part time, full time, and quick one day courses on all variety of tech topics. Their courses are taught by professionals and the offerings are diverse.</p>
    <h2>Learn in Your Pajamas</h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.codeschool.com">Code School</a><br />
    Code School is the best online, video-based learning site I have found for web development topics. It&#8217;s probably best for people who are slightly past the beginning phase (try Treehouse or Codecademy for that), but their &#8220;tracks&#8221; make it easy to dabble and then develop in an area of interest with focus. I&#8217;m steadily working my way through just about every module they provide, and it&#8217;s been huge in terms of learning standards and brushing up on basics. Learning the right way to do things in the first place is the way to go.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.lynda.com">Lynda</a><br />
    I first found Lynda because Apple provided it to me as an employee. It&#8217;s a fantastic way to learn a lot of different specialized topics. I used it to level-up on Photoshop and XML, and I&#8217;d say their most useful offerings are those in the design/Adobe Suite category.</p>
    <h2>Support, Networking, and More</h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.shegeeksout.com/">She Geeks Out</a><br />
    There is good food. There are geeky raffle prizes. There are amazingly cool lectures on topics ranging from a womens&#8217; history of software engineering to gender representation on Wikipedia. And the best part? There are other amazing women to meet who do geeky stuff for a living just like you. Meet some new friends, colleagues, and badasses every month for a super cheap ticket price that all goes to a non-profit for girls in STEM. Could I love it any more? I could not.</p>
